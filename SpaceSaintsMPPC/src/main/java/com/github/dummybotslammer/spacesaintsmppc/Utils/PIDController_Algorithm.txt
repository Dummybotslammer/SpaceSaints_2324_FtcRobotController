A. TRACK FOLLOW
1. A path is marked from point A to B, though more points can be used to describe more complicated geometry.
    Path = r(t)
2. Path is also initialised with data about the target speed.
    Path Speed  = s
3. Program Begins:
4. Init Time = t
4. Set TargetPoint = r(t)
5. Set ErrorVec =
