A. TRACK FOLLOW
1. A path is marked from point A to B, though more points can be used to describe more complicated geometry.
    Path = r(t)
2. Path is also initialised with data about the target speed.
    Path Speed  = s
3. while not at Point B
4. Init Time = t
5. Set TargetPoint = r(t)
6. Set ErrorVec = TargetPoint - CurrentRobotPosition
7. Pass ErrorVec into the Vector PID controller.
8. Use the output to move the robot
9. repeat until at point B
